### `img/2014-09-11/*.tif` ###
These images were taken on the lab microscope on Sept. 11th,
2014.
They are of emulsions inoculated with citrine expressing E. coli.

As of now, the files are not hosted online, but can be retrieved from the
microscope computer in `Documents/Byron/emulsions/2014-09-11`

The files are in the TIFF format.
Filenames describe most of the relevant metadata.

`[SURF]surf_[AQ%]-aq_[HZ]-hz_[TIME]-s_[INC]-hrs-inc_1to[DIL]dilut_r[R]s[S]f[F]_[CHAN].tif`
where:
-  [SURF] is the percent surfactant
-  [AQ%] is the proportion of aqueous phase
-  [HZ] is the shaking speed in Hz's.
-  [TIME] is the shaking time in seconds
-  [INC] is the incubation time in hours
-  [DIL] is the dilution factor of the culture
-  [R] is the replicate emulsion
-  [S] is the replicate slide
-  [F] is the replicate field of view
-  [CHAN] specifies the color channel (bf, df, yellow, blue)
    -  This field is not particularly systematically filled.
